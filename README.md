# How to run the code

The first thing to focus on is importing the data. We imported the data from Kaggle, using the command:
import kagglehub
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification")
 This command stores the data at location: path. Note that the following code might have to be modified to accommodate the user's given path. We then moved the data to the present working directory using the command: mv path/* .
 If this does not work, we have also provided the data file in the GitHub repository.

The remainder of the code is run simply by going through the python notebook sequentially. 

Note that you will need to have access to a GPU to run this code. 
Note that some of the graphs may vary as the model's final weights depend on the random initialization of the weights.

# Describe any pretrained models or datasets used
The dataset used in GTZAN, which contains 1000 audio clips (10 genres, 100 clips each), each 30 seconds long, at 22050Hz, and is the standard benchmark for music genre classification.
We used wav2vec, a pretrained audio transformer designed by Facebook to embed the audio files. However, we quickly veered away from this and used mel spectrograms instead.
